# dotfiles
Configuration files for various softwares.

I upload configuration files (often named dotfiles as they usually start with a dot) in this repo. I normally write them on Linux but they should work on OS X. In order to use a file, simply copy it to its location on your machine. Be careful when you overwrite files and create backups ! :-)

Here is a list of the files :

* **.irssi/config**  [https://irssi.org/](irssi) configuration file. Uses [https://github.com/claytron/dotfiles/blob/master/.irssi/scripts/tmux_away.pl](tmux-away) and [https://github.com/mjholtkamp/irssi-trackbar](trackbar) with the [https://github.com/huyz/irssi-colors-solarized](solarized-universal) theme.
* **.i3/config** [https://i3wm.org/](i3 Window Manager) configuration file. Zenburn style. 
* **.tmux.conf** [https://tmux.github.io/](tmux) configuration file. Uses [https://github.com/powerline/powerline](Powerline) installed via pip.
