# dotfiles

Configuration files for various softwares.

I upload configuration files (often named dotfiles as
they usually start with a dot) in this repo. I normally
write them on Linux but they should work on OS X. In
order to use a file, simply copy it to its location on
your machine or create a symbolic link. Be careful when you overwrite files and
create backups ! :-)

Here is a list of the files :

* **.i3/config** >  [i3 Window Manager](https://i3wm.org/) configuration file.
  Zenburn style.
* **sublime_text/** > [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) configuration file. 
  Requires [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) for the plugins to install.
* **.gitconfig** > My personnal configuration file for Git. You can propably
  ignore this ! :-)
* **.tmux.conf** > [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) configuration file. Uses
  [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) installed via pip.
  Different shortcuts.
* **.vimrc** > [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) configuration file. Uses
  [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) installed via pip. There
  are also many plugins installed via
  [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
* **README.md** > This file.
* **.zshrc** > Configuration file for the [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) shell with
  [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Various plugins, see
  comments in file.
